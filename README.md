## Metrics report

Run the `generateMetrics.sh` script to generate a metrics report about the model and the generated artifacts. Make sure to generate the artifacts before running the script. This script only works on Unix-based systems, but you can use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on Windows.

```bash
chmod +x generateMetrics.sh
./generateMetrics.sh
```
